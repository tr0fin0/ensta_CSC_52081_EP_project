    \section{Methodology/Approach ($\approx 1$-$2$ pages)}

    As this report is about reinforcement learning, it should involve discussion of at least one environment, and at least one agent. Since you already introduced the general background and concepts you are using in Section~\ref{sec:background}, here you can get straight into the specific details of \emph{your} approach; basically, providing details on item~\ref{item:approach} in Section~\ref{sec:intro}. What did you implement, what experiments did you do (and why); including details of your approach to hyper-parameterization. 

    For example, if you propose a new environment, you would define the state space, action space, reward function, transition function; here.

    As elsewhere in the report, don't hesitate to use diagrams, figures, and screenshots wherever they can be useful. And precisely and ambiguously credit any work (code, theory, or otherwise) that you are using, building from, or comparing to; via an appropriate reference.
