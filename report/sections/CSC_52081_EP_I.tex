    \section{Introduction ($\approx$ 1 page)}
    \label{sec:intro}

    In this section, answer the following:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item What aspect of RL are you specifically looking at? (Recall: something, or based on something you have studied in class).
        \item Why is this aspect interesting / relevant to RL?
        \item What are the challenges involved?
        \item What is known/what has been done by others?
        \item \label{item:approach} What is your approach? (What exactly did you do?), e.g., design a new environment, approach a real-world problem, study a particular agent, or a survey different agents, carry out a theoretical analysis, provide new empirical results \ldots) -- be precise and unambiguous.
        \item What are your main results? What do they imply? (What did you learn?)
        \item What are the specific limitations (what could be done next if you had time).
        \item A link to your [anonymous] code/implementation, which can be used to reproduce your results.
    \end{enumerate}

    This introduction is a complete view of your work, everything that follows is only a means to justify your claims/provide a detailed view of your findings.
